# JavaMenuProgram
Use of OOP
Joe's menu program has many features to be able to see the functionality of the menu.
The program uses numbers 0 through 8, each all having a different function.
There is a while loop until you press 0 so that you can keep navigating through the menu.
Words are used when adding a menu item and will be added to the list and printed out automatically.
If you remove an item, you pick the number it is assigned and it will reprint the new list.
Finally, the scanner takes in all information about the menu item, but only prints out the dish and it's price.
Attached are two screenshots showing every function from 0 to 8.
